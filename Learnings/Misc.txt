1. DP?
2. Try answering queries in reverse order?

Square Root Decomp Type? (Solve Q in 2 methods.. one method will be used for 
<=sqrt(n) other for greater)

3. Check for queue, priorioty_queue, stack, ordered_set solutions
stack => LIFO (whatever goes in last comes out last)
queue => FIFO (whatever goes in first comes out first)
priority_queue => Dynamic queries of minimum/maximum
ordered_set => set in vector form
[order_of_key(k) gives number of elements less than k, find_by_order(i) gives i^th element]

4. Binary Search the Answer(or just Binary Search)
5. Bitmask
6. For sets use s.lower_bound() 
7. When using class and struct dont forget to put the value in the "global" variable
8. Dont forget to put is_set = true in lazysegtree
9. #define endl '\n'

10. Number of swaps in bubble sort = Number of inversions in the array
11. Consider array elements as points on coordinate plane (a[i],i)
12. Bitset? (n = 5e4 or something suggests bitset)
