Convert Tree to Array

Binary Lifting

It is a common technique to calculate two DP arrays
One DP array for results within the subtree (Sometimes only this)
Other DP array calculates results outside of the subtree (sometimes only this)

If you are storing a vector or cht or some ds in nodes of tree, and you
have to unite them to get something for a node.. 
Consider the "heavy Child"

dist(u,v) = depth[u] + depth[v] - 2*depth[lca]	

Consider diameter of the tree?

In HLD seg = new SegTree; if(depth[u]>depth[v]) and if(depth[head[u]]<depth[head[v]])
In HLD dont forget depth[0] = 0, parent[0] = -1;
