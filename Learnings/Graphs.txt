Some common ways for solving a Graph Problem

1. Topological Sort (Problems generally say "no directed cycles")
a. This gives an ordering such that node u comes before node v if node u is connected to node v
b. It is useful for questions involving DAG[Directed Acyclic Graph]
c. If you want a DFS to start at node u just do DFS Method starting with node u

2. UFDS(or DSU)
a. This gives a structure for giving nodes that are connected to each other
b. We can join nodes together and get values of connected componenets

3. DFS/BFS
a. if we just want to do a Depth First Search(pretty useful for various stuff)
b. If we want to find shortest distance etc. Breadth First Search is good.
