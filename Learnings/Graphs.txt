Some common ways for solving a Graph Problem

1. Directed Graphs
a. If no cycles => Topological sorting
b. Otherwise, SCC decomposition and then make it to Topological

2. UFDS(or DSU)
a. This gives a structure for giving nodes that are connected to each other
b. We can join nodes together and get values of connected componenets

3. DFS/BFS
a. if we just want to do a Depth First Search(pretty useful for various stuff)
b. If we want to find shortest distance etc. Breadth First Search is good.

If there are states for a problem, for example you can go either vertical
or horizontal, make vertices for all the states..
